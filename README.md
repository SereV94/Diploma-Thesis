Thesis Project on Emotion Recognition from EEG-signals

This repo contains all the coding part related to the work I have done for my Diploma thesis 
during the last year of my undergraduate studies at the Electrical and Computer Engineering department
of National Technical University of Athens (NTUA).

The whole code is in Matlab and there will be a small description of the functionality of each script 
in every .m file.
